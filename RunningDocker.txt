# How to run the docker container

1. Make sure that docker is installed on your computer and that the docker daemon is running
2. From the src folder, run this command:
	docker build -t project .
	This will create the container named project from the Dockerfile
3. To run this container run this command:
	sudo docker run -p 8000:8000 project
	Which will publish the docker port 8000 to your local host 8000
4. At this point, you should be able to access the webpage at 127.0.0.1:8000
If you want to kill the container, run: 
	docker ps
	Which will print the containers that are currently running with their Ids, to kill a container run:
	docker kill CONTAINER_ID
